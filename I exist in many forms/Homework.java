While estimates of its length vary, China’s National Administration of Cultural Heritage reports the wall to be an impressive 13,170 miles (21,195 kilometers) long. Walking the entire wall nonstop would take approximately 17 months! Some work on the wall dates back to the 7th century BCE, although the Ming Dynasty constructed the principal, most well-preserved parts between 1368 and 1644. Contrary to popular belief, the Great Wall of China is not a singular, connected wall. It actually consists of numerous walls, some parallel for stretches, accompanied by watch towers and platforms. China built the Great Wall to better protect its northern border, although its effectiveness is debated. The Great Wall has been a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1987. Today, over 10 million tourists visit the wall every year. Visitors can easily access it from Beijing.");

The Mayan tribe, Itzá, was responsible for many of the structures built in this city. The most well-known pyramid in Chichén Itza is El Castillo, a four-sided pyramid that is 185 feet (55.5 meters) wide and 78 feet (24 meters) tall. Impressively, the pyramid has 365 steps, each step representing a day of the year. During the spring and fall equinoxes, a shadow forms on the temple’s north stairway, creating the illusion of a slithering serpent. Today, 26 ruins still stand in Chichén Itzá, and approximately 2.5 million people visit the site every year. Most visitors travel from Cancun or the Rivera Maya to see Chichén Itzá." );

The Nabateans founded it in approximately the fourth century, chiseling temples, dwellings, and tombs in the stone. The Nabateans also had very advanced infrastructure, creating an impressive irrigation system of dams, canals, and reservoirs that provided water for over 30,000 participants in the otherwise arid zone. Some remnants of this irrigation system are still visible today. Visitors may recognize the ancient city from Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade, which filmed several scenes there. Petra became a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1985, and currently, around 900,000 people visit it annually.");

Thanks to this intricate building technique, many of the structures continue to stand to this day. Peruvian farmer Agustín Lizárraga was the first recorded individual to discover Machu Picchu in 1902. However, Herman Bingham brought it to the attention of the Western world in 1911 with his discovery of it. There are many theories about the reasons for Machu Picchu’s construction. Some scholars believe that Machu Picchu was a holy convent known as “Virgins of the Sun” for women who were dedicated to the Incan sun god, Inti. Other theories include the city being a royal retreat for the Emporer Pachacuti or being a trading hub or location to test new crops. In 1983, Machu Picchu became a UNESCO World Heritage site, and today, approximately 1.5 million people visit it each year.");

The mausoleum consists of white marble and semiprecious stones that form intricate floral and geometric patterns.
